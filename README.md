# Handy-Mods

A small mod that aims to extract handy features from giant mods so you can shave down your mod list, loading times, and JEI pages.

### Current features:

* Ender Box: a nice way to move blocks around while keeping their contents intact (heavily inspired by Mekanism cardboard box)
* Item Holder: single-item inventory for displaying stuff or automation (similar to one use-case of Tinkers Construct drying rack)

### Planned features:

* Chesty Crafting Table: crafting table that keeps its contents after you exit the gui (inspired by Tinkers Construct crafting station)

## To Do

* [ ] configurable blacklist (incl. box itself, bedrock)
* [ ] prevent sound still playing even if target not wrappable
* [X] allow wrapping block currently standing on
* [ ] maybe check that the block can be placed before unwrapping (makes for ugly code though)
* [X] change paper box to be ender-themed (use ender pearl in recipe, ender textures, etc.)
* [X] The One Probe integration for everything
