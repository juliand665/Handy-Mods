# Handy Mods

A small mod that aims to extract handy features from giant mods so you can shave down your mod list, loading times, and JEI pages.

Download in [the releases section](https://github.com/juliand665/Handy-Mods/releases) or on [CurseForge](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/handy-mods).

Check out [the Images section on CurseForge](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/handy-mods/images) for more details!

### Current features:

* Ender Box: a nice way to move blocks around while keeping their contents intact (heavily inspired by Mekanism cardboard box)
* Item Holder: single-item inventory for displaying stuff or automation (similar to one use-case of Tinkers Construct drying rack)
* Chesty Crafting Table: crafting table that keeps its contents after you exit the gui (inspired by Tinkers Construct crafting station)
* Ender Boxer: automatically contains the block it's pointing at within an Ender Box while provided with a redstone signal.

### Planned features:

* _Maybe_ a lightweight autonomous activator/mechanical user thing (as requested on curseforge by Chilled_dayz)

## To Do

* [ ] maybe check that the block can be placed before unwrapping (makes for ugly code though)
