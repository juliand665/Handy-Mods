# Handy-Mods

Current features:

* Paper Box (heavily inspired by Mekanism's Cardboard Box)

Planned features:

* Chesty Crafting Table (crafting table that keeps its contents after you exit the gui
* Item Holder (single-item inventory for displaying stuff or automation)

# TODO

[ ] configurable blacklist (incl. box itself, bedrock)
[ ] prevent sound still playing even if not wrappable
[ ] allow wrapping block currently standing on
[ ] maybe check that the block can be placed before unwrapping (makes for ugly code though)
